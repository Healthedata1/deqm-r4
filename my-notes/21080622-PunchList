Davinci MRP Profiles Issues and Punch List:

IG Link:  http://build.fhir.org/ig/Healthedata1/DaVinci/guidance.html

TODO:
  Introductions
  Requirements for each constraints
  Examples
  Profile/extension names to be cleaned up
  Need both a generic profile and MRP specific profile:
   MeasureReport
   Observation
   Task

task-measure - drafted
  code (see Observation too) value set to include cpt & snomed measure codes - need to define these codes
  fix xpath2 for invariant - ask Lloyd
  create value set for statusReason ( if no status then why ) discuss whether this should be text only

task-mrp - drafted
  this just fixes the binding for the code

observation-measure - drafted
  code value set to include cpt & snomed measure code ( need to get codes )
  review  Observation.value codes
  if no status then dataAbsentReason should - this could be text only or could require text too.

observation-mrp
    this just fixes the binding for the code

davinci-MeasureReport - drafted
  - general profile
  - change measure to reference canonical urls
  - What is the scope of using MeasureReport - i.e., 'just' for quality measures? ( vs Scope of DaVinci - reimbursement beyond Quality measures?

measurereport-MRP
   this just fixes the measure to mrp canonical url and referenceresources to Task and Observation measure profiles

Measure - ...todo...
  - do we need to a profile or simply point to Hedis IG?

Patient -drafted

PractitionerRole - used US Core to start3

Practitioner - drafted
 - using 'PRN' for type check if this code is appropriate - discuss  - other option is to create own code)

Organization - drafted
 - technically the slicing needs to be fixed)

Location - drafted
  - question: managingOrganization - this may not the same as org and not how you would get to the org you want.  use measureReport to get it (see the graph).

Coverage  - ...todo...
  - use: http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/scheduling/StructureDefinition-argo-coverage.html to start
