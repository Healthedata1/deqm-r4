<li>The effect of invoking this operation is to gather the data required for reporting a measure for a patient.</li>
<li>The id of the instance endpoint,  for example 'measure-mrp'  in <code>[base]/MeasureReport/measure-mrp/$collectData</code> determines which measure data is returned.</li>
<li>The required data for each measure is discoverable by invoking the <a href="todo.html"><code>$[measure]-requirements</code></a> operation on the payer's <code>Measure</code> endpoint.</li>
<li>If the lastReceivedOn parameter is supplied, only data that is new or has been changed since the lastReceivedOn date is included in the response</li>
