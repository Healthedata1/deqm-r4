<p>The Da Vinci Observation Measure Profile defines the constraints for representing the completion of a quality measure.  Task is the preferred Resource for sharing measure attestation information.  However, if your system cannot generate Task Resource for this purpose, an Observation Resource may be used.  This Resource contains the date and code that allows the payer to know that the measure was performed</p>
